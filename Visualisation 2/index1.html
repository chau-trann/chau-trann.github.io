        <h1>Causes of Death Over Time</h1>
        <p>Evaluating the health of a population is most commonly measured by examining mortality,
           including metrics like child mortality and life expectancy, which are derived from mortality 
           estimates. However, concentrating solely on mortality overlooks the broader impact of diseases, 
           as they not only result in death but also inflict suffering on those living with them. A comprehensive
           assessment of health outcomes should consider both mortality and morbidity, encompassing prevalent diseases,
           to offer a more holistic perspective on the overall health status.</p>

          <h2> Total Deaths Over Time</h2>
          <p>The data presented encapsulates the total cases of death globally, offering a comprehensive view of the impact beyond mere mortality figures. Spanning the extensive period from 1990 to 2019, this dataset provides insights into the broader spectrum of health outcomes, acknowledging that <FONT COLOR="#FFAD7B" ><b>diseases</b></FONT> not only result in fatalities but also <FONT COLOR="#FFAD7B" ><b>contribute significantly to overall morbidity</b></FONT>.

            <br><br>In examining the worldwide distribution, it becomes evident that certain countries have higher level of deaths. Notably, <FONT COLOR="#377eb8"><b>China and India</b></FONT> can be seen consistently registering some of the <FONT COLOR="#FFAD7B" ><b>highest death counts</b></FONT>. This observation aligns with the fact that both <FONT COLOR="#377eb8"><b>China and India</b></FONT> boast the largest populations globally. </p>

          <p><br> The correlation between high death counts and population size shows the relationship between demographic factors and health outcomes. <FONT COLOR="#FFAD7B" ><b>Larger populations inherently face a higher risk of diseases spreading</b></FONT>, potentially leading to increased cases of death.

            <br><br>By looking at causes of deaths rather than just using the mortality metrics and  <FONT COLOR="#FFAD7B" ><b>elving into the broader context</b></FONT> of total death cases, allows us to have a <FONT COLOR="#FFAD7B" ><b>better understanding</b></FONT> of the global health landscape. It shows the big impact that diseases contributes to death totals, emphasizing the need for comprehensive approaches to public health that extend beyond mortality considerations. </p>

          <p>
            The dataset sescribes the relationship of <FONT COLOR="#FFAD7B" ><b>deaths associated with alcohol and drug use</b></FONT>, revealing intriguing patterns over time and across countries. Particularly, early data highlights a considerable toll in <FONT COLOR="#377eb8"><b>China</b></FONT>, where <FONT COLOR="#FFAD7B" ><b>drug-related deaths were markedly higher</b></FONT> compared to other nations. This observation prompts a deeper exploration into the historical context and societal factors that contributed to this elevated mortality rate.
            
            <br><br><FONT COLOR="#ff7f00"><b>Russia</b></FONT> emerges as a focal point for <FONT COLOR="#FFAD7B" ><b>deaths linked to alcohol consumption</b></FONT>. However, a positive shift can be seen, suggesting a potential impact from health promotion campaigns or evolving societal attitudes toward alcohol. The <FONT COLOR="#FFAD7B" ><b>decrease in alcohol-related deaths</b></FONT> implies a positive trend, reflecting the efficacy of <FONT COLOR="#FFAD7B" ><b>public health initiatives</b></FONT> in mitigating this particular cause of mortality.
            
            <br><br>In contrast, the <FONT COLOR="#e41a1c"><b>United States</b></FONT> presents a contrasting result, as there is a substantial increase in deaths attributed to drug use. <FONT COLOR="#FFAD7B" ><b>Understanding</b></FONT> this surge in <FONT COLOR="#FFAD7B" ><b>drug-related deaths</b></FONT> is crucial for the formulation of targeted interventions and policy measures to address the underlying causes.
            
            <br><br>Overall, the dataset offers an insight into the changes of deaths associated with alcohol and drug use. It invites exploration into the cultural, social, and policy contexts that shape these trends, facilitating a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities for public health interventions on a global scale.</p>
